Conway's life in AngularJS

This project is an implementation of Conway's life for the web, based on the application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.

I have not cleaned out all the skeleton code, as this is here primarily for experimentation and demonstration purposes.
